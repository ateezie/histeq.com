### âœ… Premium States Coverage Implementation
**Date**: September 24, 2025
**Commit**: bc36c7a - "Implement premium states coverage section and authentic company copy"

#### **Major Improvements:**

1. **Premium Badge Layout for States Coverage**
   - **Problem**: Basic grid of state abbreviations looked unprofessional
   - **Solution**: Implemented regional organization with professional badge system
   - **Features**:
     - Regional grouping: Midwest Stronghold, Southern Markets, Northeastern Markets
     - Color-coded regions using Historic Equity brand colors
     - HQ designation for Missouri headquarters
     - Hover effects and responsive design (2â†’4â†’6 columns)
     - Professional visual impact demonstrating geographic reach

2. **Authentic Historic Equity Content Integration**
   - **Problem**: Placeholder content didn't reflect real company information
   - **Solution**: Integrated authentic copy from `/context/copy-document.md`
   - **Content Updates**:
     - Real company description: "Historic Equity, Inc. ("HEI") is a full service consultant and investor specializing in state historic tax credit ("SHTC") projects"
     - Authentic services: Specialized Expertise, Full-Service Partner, Established Network, Flexible Model
     - Real statistics: 23+ years experience, 250+ projects, $1B+ QRE
     - Actual team member profiles with credentials and experience

3. **Consistent Vertical Padding Resolution**
   - **Problem**: Inconsistent vertical spacing across sections, hero section had 0px padding
   - **Solution**: Standardized all sections to use `py-24` (96px) consistent padding
   - **Results**: Perfect spacing consistency across all 7 sections on all viewport sizes

4. **Typography Optimization**
   - **Problem**: H1 was taking up 82%+ of viewport height
   - **Solution**: Reduced to professional standards (48px desktop, 40px mobile)
