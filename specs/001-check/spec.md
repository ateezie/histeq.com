# Feature Specification: System Health Check

**Feature Branch**: `001-check`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "check"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: system verification, status monitoring, validation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific check targets not specified]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: check frequency and automation requirements]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user permissions for accessing checks]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Basic user flow: user requests system status, receives report
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Marked ambiguous requirements with clarification needs
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Check results, system components, status reports
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties due to generic input"
   ’ No implementation details found
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator or user, I need to verify that all system components are functioning correctly so that I can identify issues before they impact users and ensure system reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has appropriate permissions, **When** they request a system check, **Then** they receive a comprehensive status report showing all monitored components
2. **Given** the system is running normally, **When** a check is performed, **Then** all components show "healthy" status with relevant metrics
3. **Given** a system component has failed, **When** a check is performed, **Then** the failed component is clearly identified with error details
4. **Given** a user requests a check, **When** the system is under heavy load, **Then** the check completes within acceptable time limits

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the check system itself experiences failures?
- How does the system handle partial component failures during check execution?
- What occurs when check requests exceed system capacity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a mechanism to verify the operational status of all critical components
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate status reports that clearly indicate healthy vs. problematic components
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to initiate system checks [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: manual only or automated scheduling?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST complete basic health checks within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable response time not specified]
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all check activities for audit purposes
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users before allowing check access [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: required permission level not specified]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide check results in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: output format not specified - UI, API, report file?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle check failures gracefully without impacting monitored components

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Check Result**: Represents the outcome of a system verification, includes timestamp, component status, metrics, and error details if applicable
- **System Component**: Represents a monitored part of the system, includes name, status, dependencies, and health criteria
- **Status Report**: Aggregated view of all check results, includes overall system health, individual component statuses, and recommendations
