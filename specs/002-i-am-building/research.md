# Research: Lead-Generating WordPress Theme

## Contact Form Lead Generation Research

### Decision: WordPress Contact Form 7 + Custom Lead Qualification
**Rationale**: Contact Form 7 provides reliable form handling with extensive customization options. Custom fields for lead qualification (project location, property type, timeline, budget range) will help Historic Equity prioritize leads.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Gravity Forms (premium, but more complex than needed)
- Custom PHP forms (more development overhead)
- Ninja Forms (less WordPress standard adoption)

### Decision: FlyntWP Component Architecture for Reusability
**Rationale**: FlyntWP provides structured component approach for modular design. Components can be reused across pages (hero sections, contact forms, project showcases) maintaining consistency and reducing code duplication.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom WordPress blocks (Gutenberg) - more complex setup
- Direct theme templates - less modular and reusable
- Page builders - not suitable for custom development needs

### Decision: TailwindCSS for Responsive Design Implementation
**Rationale**: TailwindCSS utility-first approach enables rapid responsive development with consistent spacing, colors, and breakpoints. Historic Equity brand colors can be configured as custom utilities.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Custom SCSS only - more development time for responsive utilities
- Bootstrap - conflicts with custom brand design requirements
- CSS-in-JS - not suitable for WordPress/PHP environment

## WordPress Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Timber/Twig Templating for Separation of Concerns
**Rationale**: Timber provides clean separation between PHP logic and HTML presentation. Twig templates are more readable and maintainable than mixing PHP with HTML.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure PHP templates - harder to maintain and read
- WordPress block themes - not suitable for custom component requirements
- Headless WordPress - unnecessary complexity for this use case

### Decision: Custom Post Types for Project Showcases
**Rationale**: Projects need structured data (location, property type, investment details, outcomes). Custom Post Types provide WordPress-native content management with custom fields.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Regular posts with categories - less structured data management
- External database - unnecessary complexity
- Static content - not manageable by client

### Decision: WordPress Customizer for Brand Color Management
**Rationale**: Allows client to adjust brand colors if needed while maintaining design system integrity. Colors can be output as CSS custom properties.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Hard-coded colors - not flexible for brand adjustments
- Theme options page - more complex development
- File-based configuration - not user-friendly

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Webpack + PostCSS + Babel Build Pipeline
**Rationale**: Enables modern JavaScript/CSS development with automatic optimization, minification, and browser compatibility. Integrates well with TailwindCSS purging for smaller file sizes.

**Alternatives considered**:
- WordPress native enqueuing only - no modern build optimizations
- Gulp/Grunt - less modern development experience
- Parcel/Vite - not commonly used in WordPress ecosystem

### Decision: Lazy Loading + Image Optimization Strategy
**Rationale**: Project showcase images are major performance factor. Native lazy loading + WebP format + responsive images ensure fast loading while maintaining visual quality.

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript lazy loading libraries - unnecessary when native support available
- Single image sizes - poor performance across devices
- No optimization - would violate <3s load time requirement

## Lead Conversion Optimization Research

### Decision: Strategic CTA Placement Throughout User Journey
**Rationale**: Multiple contact opportunities increase conversion rates. CTAs should appear after value proposition, project examples, and service explanations.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single contact page only - lower conversion rates
- Popup forms - potentially intrusive user experience
- Chatbot integration - unnecessary complexity for B2B context

### Decision: Trust Indicators and Social Proof Integration
**Rationale**: B2B services require credibility indicators. Company background, team expertise, successful project examples, and testimonials build trust necessary for high-value inquiries.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimal company information - insufficient for B2B trust building
- External testimonial platforms - less integrated experience
- No social proof - missed conversion opportunities

### Decision: State-Specific Landing Pages for SEO and Relevance
**Rationale**: Historic Equity serves 17+ states with different regulations. State-specific pages improve SEO rankings and provide relevant information for local prospects.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single national page - less relevant for local searches
- Dynamic state detection - more complex development
- External state information - less integrated user experience

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### Decision: Mobile-First Responsive Design Approach
**Rationale**: Mobile traffic increasingly important for B2B research. Mobile-first ensures optimal experience across all devices while meeting Core Web Vitals requirements.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Desktop-first approach - suboptimal mobile experience
- Separate mobile site - maintenance overhead
- Non-responsive design - unacceptable for modern standards

### Decision: WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Implementation
**Rationale**: Legal requirement and moral imperative. Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast compliance ensure inclusive access.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Minimum accessibility - legal and ethical risks
- WCAG AAA level - unnecessary complexity for most users
- Post-launch accessibility audit - more expensive to retrofit
